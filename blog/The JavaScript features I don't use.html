<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>I have been working with JavaScript for several years now and I have a strong
background of C/C++ and .NET programming. Most of the time, I try to write
'elegant' code, meaning that I like to make it reliable, efficient and as
reusable as possible.</p>

<p>Through this article, I would like to share why I forbid some keywords and
syntax from my code. Indeed, based on personal experience, they appeared to be
more dangerous than helpful.</p>

<h1>with</h1>

<p>If you search documentation on the internet, you will discover that this
keyword is globally accepted as a bad practice.</p>

<code class="javascript">
var A = function (initial) {
    this.member = initial;
}

var a = new A(0);
with(a) {
    var member = 5;
}
alert(a.member);
</code>

<p>The recommended workaround is to create a variable that contains what you
would put in with. For instance:</p>


<code class="javascript">
// Avoid
with (gpf.bin) {
    var result = pow2(4);
}

// Use instead
var gpfb = gpf.bin;
var result = gpfb.pow2(4);
</code>


<h1>switch</h1>

It uses == instead of ===
Flow breaking
    
   Most of the time I use if () else if () or, ultimately, a map.

<h1>eval</h1>

JSHint generates an error this instruction named 'eval is evil'.

However, this possibility exists in only few languages and is really powerful.


Use new Function()

<h1>condition ? whenTrue : otherwise</h1>
