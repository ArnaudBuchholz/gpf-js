    <h2>What did I spend my time on during the last months?</h2>

<p>I know that the blog activity does not reflect this reality but I have been
working on my library during my - rare - spare time.
For instance, I tried to organize the different features into namespaces to
avoid creating one object containing all the methods.
<br />
Since I started the new job, I also rewrote some of it to fit most of JSLint
validation rules and changed the way tests are made to support several hosts
(<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490887.aspx"
target="_blank">cscript</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodeJS
</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers"
target="_blank">browser</a>).</p>

<p>One interesting problem I had to deal with is related to the way attributes
are handled in my implementation. Attributes could be compared to the Java
annotations: they are information added to the source code that are retrieved
at run-time using specific methods.
They are used to generate code (such as object members' accessors) or customize
behaviors (such as XML serialization).</p>

<p>I will write an article later about that very specific topic.</p>

<p>The problem I had to deal with is related to classes and inheritance: indeed,
it sounds natural to inherit the attributes and - as a consequence - I needed
the possibility to walk through the class hierarchy.<br />
Also, I wanted to simplify the way attributes are created so I wrote aliases for
constructors (let say object factories).</p>

<p>I learned a lot by implementing these methods and I would like to share with
you my understanding of how objects are handled in JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Classes and inheritance</h2>

<p>First of all, I will not detail the class and inheritance concepts as they
belong to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"
target="_blank">Object Oriented Programming languages</a>. So I will take the
assumption that you are familiar with these. If not, the previous link is a
good starting point.</p>

<p>But, also, the main reason is that JavaScript is <b>*not*</b> an usual OOP
language: it misses lots of interesting features such as the possibility to
control members visibility (using private, protected and public), polymorphism
or operators....</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the <span class="keyword">class</span> keyword is
reserved but you can't do anything with it. You will also discover that the
<span class="keyword">delete</span> keyword exists but for a different usage.
</p>

<p>That's why I would like to explain what is a JavaScript object, how it is
declared and the way it can be manipulated in order to highlight what can be
done and illustrate what can't.</p>

    <h3>Objects and members</h3>

        <h4>My first object</h4>

<p>In the JavaScript language, the simplest (and shortest) way to create an
object is to write the following line of code:</p>
<code class="javascript">var myObject1 = {};</code>

<p>The following syntax is strictly equivalent:</p>
<code class="javascript">var myObject2 = new Object();</code>

<p>Those who are used to program with real OOP languages will recognize the use
of the <span class="keyword">new</span> operator.<br/> I will come back later to
this one, we will first focus on the result.</p>

<p>Both samples are generating an empty object and once created, it already
exposes a number of predefined members (mostly methods), for instance:
<ul>
    <li><span class="keyword">toString</span> a method that returns a
        string representation of the object</li>
    <li><span class="keyword">hasOwnProperty</span> a method that will become
        helpful later in this article</li>
    <li><span class="keyword">constructor</span> an object that will also be
        explained later</li>
</ul>
</p>

        <h4>Members</h4>

<p>To access the members (or call the methods), you can use either the "."
operator or the "[]" one:</p>
<code class="javascript">var string1 = myObject1.toString();
var string2 = myObject2["toString"]();</code>

<div class="note">Calling a method is actually done in two steps: in JavaScript,
functions are objects. When you access the member named "toString" on myObject1,
it returns the function object. Then, the parenthesis are used to call the
function and provide parameters. </div>

<p>Usually, the bracket operator is used whenever the member name is
contained in a variable or if the name is an invalid identifier
(just try to access the member named "my field" with the dot operator).</p>

<p>The real power of JavaScript compared to classical OOP languages is the fact
that you can dynamically add any member to any object.<br />
Again, there are several syntaxes you can use:</p>

<code class="javascript">myObject1.additionalMember = "value";
myObject2["member"] = "value";
myObject1["member"] === myObject2.member;</code>

<p>Indeed, assigning a member on an object will either update the member (if
already existing) or create it.</p>

<div class="note">This simplicity is probably one of the most exciting feature
of the JavaScript language. As a consequence, any object can be used as a map
and there is virtually no limit to the number of members you can add to an
object.<br/>
Very often, I used them as dictionary (to associate keys to values).
</div>

<p>If you want to initialize the object with members, you can add them one by
one:</p>
<code class="javascript">var johnSmith = new Object();
johnSmith.firstName = "John";
johnSmith.lastName = "Smith";
johnSmith.age = 25;
johnSmith.address = new Object();
johnSmith.address.streetAddress = "21 2nd Street";
johnSmith.address.city = "New York";
johnSmith.address.state = "NY";
johnSmith.address.postalCode = 10021;</code>

<p>Or you can make it simpler by using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation"
target="_blank">JSON</a> notation:</p>
<code class="javascript">var johnSmith = {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "age": 25,
        "address": {
        "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postalCode": 10021
    }
};</code>

<p>This means that, unlike a strict OOP language, you can't be sure that your
object will respect a given structure (or interface). To be more precise
prototyping (that I will explain below) can help you ensure that the object has
a minimum set of properties.</p>

        <h4>Object inspection</h4>

<p>In any case, the JavaScript language also offers operators to inspect an
object definition. Considering the fact that JavaScript allows you to check any
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity" target="_blank">function arity</a>,
it provides you a working concept of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)"
target="_blank">reflection</a>.</p>

<p>Before going any further, accessing a member that is not defined does not
generate any error. Instead, JavaScript returns a special value that represents
this missing definition.</p>

<div class="note">I hear some screams regarding the above assertion as most of
us faced errors related to values that were not defined. However, please take a
closer look at what really happened and you will realize that the error came
from the use of the undefined value rather than its access.</div>

<p>The keyword <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
Reference/Global_Objects/undefined" target="_blank"><span class="keyword">
undefined</span></a> allows you to test this situation:</p>

<code class="javascript">if (undefined === myObject1.notYetDefined) {
    myObject1.notYetDefined = "OK";
}</code>

<p>You may also want to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof" target="_blank">
<span class="keyword">typeof</span></a></b> operator:<br />
<code class="javascript">if ("undefined" === typeof myObject1.notYetDefined) {
    myObject1.notYetDefined = "OK";
}</code>

<div class="note">I usually compare a value with
<span class="keyword">undefined</span> rather than using
<span class="keyword">typeof</span>. However, they are some situations where you
have no choice. For instance, if you want to test if a global variable (so we
are not really accessing a member), you have to use
<span class="keyword">typeof</span>.</div>

<p>So, those two operators allows you to verify if a member exists for a given
object.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might want to list all the members that are currently
existing on the object. <br/>
This is where you will start using the operator
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Operators/in"target="_blank"><span class="keyword">in</span></a> <i>(this is
also where the "[]" operator becomes really useful)</i>:</p>

<code class="javascript">for (var member in myObject1) {
    alert(myObject1[member]); // Display the content of the member
}</code>

<p>Another use of the <span class="keyword">in</span> operator is to test if a
member exists in an object:</p>

<code class="javascript">if (!("notYetDefined" in myObject1)) {
    myObject1.notYetDefined = "OK";
}</code>

<div class="note">There are lots of debate on the internet to know which method
is the best to enumerate object members. For instance, JSLint does not allow the
use of <span class="keyword">for in</span> without using the
<span class="keyword">hasOwnProperty</span>.
<br/>
My opinion is that it depends on what you really want to test and - right now -
I just want to verify if myObject1 has a member named "notYetDefined" which is
exactly what <b>in</b> is doing.
<br/>
I hope things will become more clear in the next chapter.</div>

        <h4>Delete</h4>

<p>To conclude with object inspection, there is one last operator that is not
widely known and rarely used but it can be helpful when applied wisely (I will
provide an example later): <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/
Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete" target="_blank">
<span class="keyword">delete</span></a>. As documented, it is used to remove a
property from an object. It means that, unlike OOP languages, it does not 'free'
objects.<br />
An example of use:</p>
<code class="javascript">if (!("notYetDefined" in myObject1)) {
    myObject1.notYetDefined = "OK";
}
// Do something that relies on myObject1.notYetDefined
console.log(myObject1.notYetDefined);
// This will remove "notYetDefined"
delete myObject1.notYetDefined;
// Now "notYetDefined" is no more a property of in myObject1
console.log(typeof myObject1.notYetDefined);</code>

<code class="output">OK
undefined</code>

<p>However, <span class="keyword">delete</span> might seem to be dysfunctional
in some cases.</p>

    <h3>Objects' own members vs prototype</h3>

<p>The above sentence being confusing, here is an example to illustrate it:</p>

<code class="javascript">var test = new Object();
if ("toString" in test) {
    console.log("test has \"toString\"");
} else {
    console.log("test doesn't have \"toString\"");
}
delete test.toString;
if ("toString" in test) {
    console.log("test still has \"toString\"");
} else {
    console.log("test doesn't have \"toString\"");
}</code>

<p>As a result, you will get:</p>

<code class="output">test has "toString"
test still has "toString"</code>

<p>According to everything that has been said before, we have two possibilities
here:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Either the <span class="keyword">delete</span> operator does not work as
        described</li>
    <li>Or the <span class="keyword">toString</span> member is not a property of
        the object</li>
</ul>

<p>First, I confirm that <span class="keyword">delete</span> operator works as
described, however the sentence <i>"remove a property from an object"</i> has to
be clarified.</p>

        <h4>hasOwnProperty</h4>

<p>The operator <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/
JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty">
<span class="keyword">hasOwnProperty</span></a> has been introduced in the
3rd edition of the ECMAScript specification and is summarized as:<br/>
<i>"returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property"
</i></p>

<p>But if you get a closer look to the documentation, the description provides
the key to understand the reason why this operator was created: <i>This method
can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a
<u>direct property</u> of that object; unlike the in operator, this method
<u>does not check down the object's prototype chain</u>.</i></p>

<p>Applied to the previous example, here is what we obtain:</p>

<code class="javascript">var test = new Object();
if ("toString" in test) {
    console.log("test has \"toString\"");
} else {
    console.log("test doesn't have \"toString\"");
}
if (test.hasOwnProperty("toString") {
    console.log("\"toString\" is a direct property of test");
} else {
    console.log("\"toString\" is *not* a direct property of test");
}</code>

<code class="output">test has "toString"
"toString" is *not* a direct property of test</code>

<p>So it means that the <span class="keyword">delete</span> operator removes a
direct property of an object.</p>

<p>Now... if "toString" is not a direct property of my object, where does it
come from ?</p>

        <h4>Prototype</h4>

<p>As a matter of fact, "toString" is defined on the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Object/prototype" target="_blank">Object prototype</a>. This
object defines all the properties and methods that are <b>inherited</b> by any
instance of a JavaScript object.</p>

<p>This is the key concept in the language that allows modern JavaScript
developers to achieve object oriented programming.</p>
