A special rule will be developed to validate the IDs.
From a general point of view, [lowerCamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) is preferred.
[Constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_%28computer_programming%29) must be uppercase with _ to separate
words. Finally, 'global' variables must start with _GPF or _gpf, they usually start with the module name
(ex: [_GpfStreamCsvParser](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/stream/csv/parser.js#L49))
