The API commonly uses the
value [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) to
represent no value. Since a method with no
[return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) statement returns
undefined, it happens often that the functions are not consistent.
